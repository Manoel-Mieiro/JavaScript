<!--Run this code in the editor, making sure it is in the window dedicated to HTML (index.html tab). 
    The <input> element is an input field where you can enter any text. In our case, weâ€™ve given this element the myId identifier.
     The <button> element, as you can guess, corresponds to ... a button. 
        Using the onClick attribute, we have indicated that if the button is clicked, a piece of JavaScript code is to be run. 
        In this code, we refer to the document object (a fragment of the DOM model), which represents our website.
         We search for the element with the myId identifier, retrieve its value (i.e. the text entered) and print the result on the console.

    As you can see, the idea is relatively simple, but both the DOM model and HTML language are definitely 
    beyond the scope of the current course. So how can we communicate with the user if we do not use these standard mechanisms?
    
    There is another solution. Please note that it is not used in modern web applications, 
    but it allows you to easily give the user the opportunity to enter data or make certain decisions.
     We will use it in this course as a dummy for normal communication, rather than as an element 
     that you will find useful in real programming. The solution is to use dialog boxes.
